# Demo for Web Speech API SpeechRecognition
NOTE: This demo is currently not supported on Firefox or Opera browsers, due to those browsers not fully supporting the Web API for SpeechRecognition. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition#browser_compatibility

## Setup
```
pnpm install
```

## Run Locally
```
pnpm run dev
```

Note: The demo uses this local version of the SDK (`"link:../.."` in package.json). If you make changes to the SDK, you'll need to build the SDK again:
```
cd ../
pnpm run build
```
